# Avengers Storybooks

In this repository, contributors will write out components that can be integrated into a storybook. No prior experience is necessary, but a drive to learning and a commitment self-improvement is expected. Reach out to get involved!

## Project Setup

It's quite easy to get started with a storybook project with `npx`, however to contribute / collaborate across this repository, you can follow the instructions below:

### `git clone https://github.com/jee-mj/storybookAvengers`

The above command will clone this repository to `storybookAvengers` in the current directory.

### `cd storybookAvengers`

We'll change directory to the root directory of the project.

### `npm i`

We'll install the packages which include Next.JS-- it basically ate React-Scripts one day and the React Development Team is happier for it.

### `npm run storybook`

After running this command, the development environment is operational and can be accessed through a browser at `localhost:6006`

## Custom Project

You can also follow the instructions at `https://storybook.js.org/` to initialise a new project, but will have difficulty in contributing back. I don't recommend you do that. We also keep notes in the `./notes` folder here.

## License

There is no license provided by default. All collaborators will be given a blind eye to the contents of this repository. The public is free to do as they wish.
