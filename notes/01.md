# Designing Components

We'll go with a simple design based off an open source colour scheme. Below are some examples:

## Colour Schemes

### [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)

I personally really like the solarized theme.

### [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)

Shayan likes the idea of using gruvbox as an influencing colour scheme.

### [dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme)

Shayan likes the idea of using dracula as an influencing colour scheme.

### [nord](https://github.com/nordtheme/nord)

Nord is a modern, well-liked, colour scheme that draws inspiration from Europa aesthetics.

### [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)

Base16 is a colour scheme developed for use on computers.

## Component Influences

There are [many examples](https://storybook.js.org/showcase) of functioning storybooks available at the Component Encyclopedia Showcase page at Storybook.

It's recommended for each contributor to stick to a single storybook, and produce components inspired by that design language.

### [Bedrock](https://www.bedrock-layout.dev/)

Bedrock provides a collection of utility components designed to be used as building blocks. The examples are simple and easy to follow along with.

### [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library/playground/ec)

The European Commission storybook follows an enterprise-friendly design language, reminiscent of [Metro UI](https://github.com/peters/winforms-modernui).

### [React95](https://react95.github.io/React95)

This is based off the Windows 95 design that was eventually replaced by Luna in Windows XP.

### [Jesus Film Project](https://storybook.core.jesusfilm.org/)

This storybook uses design conventions from the mid 2010s, where designs started accomodating responsive and dynamic components and layouts.
